I joined School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham as a PhD student since Sep. 2021, contributing to UKRI Turing AI Acceleration Fellowship project on ``Rigorous Time-Complexity Analysis of Coevolutionary Algorithms", led by Professor Per Kristian Lehre. I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor Per Kristian Lehre. 

My research mainly focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Optimisation, Evolutionary Algorithm. I am interested in reinforcement learning and the combination with evolutionary computation methods.

Before my PhD, I was a MSc Mathematics student at Imperial College London with a focus on probability theory, Markov processes and random matrix theory. I have completed my BSc Maths degree at Warwick before going to Imperial.

Me? Mathematician? Computer Scientist? Or both?
