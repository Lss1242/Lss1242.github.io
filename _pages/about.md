I joined the University of Warwick as a Research Fellow in 2025, contributing to the ERC Synergy project <a href="https://oceanerc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OCEAN</a> (On intelligenCE And Networks – Synergistic research in Bayesian Statistics, Microeconomics and Computer Sciences). The project is led by Professors Eric Moulines (École Polytechnique), Michael I. Jordan (UC Berkeley & INRIA), Christian Robert (Université Paris-Dauphine) and Gareth Roberts (University of Warwick). I work closely with <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/roberts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Gareth Roberts</a> and <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/johansen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Adam Johansen</a>.

From Sep. 2021 I have been a PhD student at the School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, contributing to the UKRI Turing AI Acceleration Fellowship project "Rigorous Time-Complexity Analysis of Coevolutionary Algorithms" (<a href="https://pklehre.github.io/EC-Theory-UoB/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project page</a>), led by <a href="https://pklehre.github.io/EC-Theory-UoB/Lehre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Per Kristian Lehre</a>. I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor Lehre.

My research mainly focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Optimisation, Evolutionary Algorithm. I am interested in reinforcement learning and the combination with evolutionary computation methods.

Before my PhD, I completed an MSc in Mathematics at Imperial College London concentrating on probability theory, Markov processes and random matrix theory, after earning a BSc in Mathematics at Warwick.

Me? Mathematician? Computer Scientist? Or both?
